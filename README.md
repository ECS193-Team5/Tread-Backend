## Technologies

The backend server is a Node.js Express server which contains most of the business logic of the application. 



1. Mongoose - This is the API used to write and update data in the MongoDB cluster.
2. Express-session + connect-mongo - This is used to store user session information in the MongoDB cluster and in the server.
3. FirebaseSDK - This is used for sending push notifications to devices through Firebase Cloud Messaging.
4. Cloudinary - This is used for storing, uploading, deleting user photos while being able to serve them quickly.


## Organization

**Index.js:** This starts the express server initializes the required services (Mongoose, firebase, Cloudinary).

**/routes:** This folder contains the routes of the server and their related functions.

**/models:** This folder contains the schemas and models used in the routes to update database collections.
